GiantCounter Plugin

This plugin scans all entities on screen and tags any Giant Rogue Exiles. Each matching exile is tagged with a unique counter (1, 2, 3, ...). You can specify to only count those appearing within range of a Ritual altar. Press the configured hotkey to snapshot the screen and force a recount, updating the numbers next to each matching exile and saving a snapshot for later counting.
